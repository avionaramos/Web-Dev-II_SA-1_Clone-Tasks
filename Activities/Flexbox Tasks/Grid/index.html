            <h1>WHAT IS HTML?</h1>
            <p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of
                elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain
                way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can
                italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.</p>
            <p>The main parts of our element are as follows: <br><br>

                The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and
                closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case
                where the paragraph begins. <br>
                The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the
                element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add
                a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results. <br>
                The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text. <br>
                The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element. <br>  </p>
