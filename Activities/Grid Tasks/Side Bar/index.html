            <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <p>My name is Aviona Ramos, an 18-year-old with a profound passion for creativity and innovation. Originally
                from the Philippines, I embarked on a transformative journey when I moved to Dubai three years ago,
                seeking to embrace new experiences and insights. This shift has allowed me to appreciate diverse
                perspectives and understand the importance of adaptability, which I now carry with me in all aspects of
                my life. <br> <br>

                Driven by an insatiable curiosity for the digital arts and an urge to create immersive user experiences,
                I chose to study Creative Computing at Bath Spa University. This program has given me the chance to
                delve deeply into web design, focusing on both the technical and aesthetic elements of crafting engaging
                and responsive webpages. Each project I undertake is an opportunity to stretch my skills, test the
                limits of my creativity, and refine my understanding of design principles. My ambition is to blend
                functionality with beauty, creating online experiences that captivate and resonate with users across
                various platforms. <br> <br>

                Beyond the world of pixels and code, I find a personal retreat in photography‚Äîa medium that allows me to
                capture fleeting moments and express the raw authenticity of human emotion. To me, photography is more
                than just an art form; it's a powerful tool for storytelling, evoking a sense of connection and
                timelessness that transcends digital screens. Through my lens, I strive to capture moments that feel
                genuine and true, preserving their essence to be shared and remembered. <br> <br>

                As I continue on this path of growth, I am committed to lifelong learning and personal development. My
                journey is fueled by a desire not only to expand my technical skills but to create work that inspires
                and leaves a lasting impact. Join me as I embark on this exciting, ever-evolving journey‚Äîwhere every new
                project becomes a chance to push boundaries, foster innovation, and contribute meaningfully to the world
                of design and beyond. <br> <br>
