    <p>My name is Aviona Ramos, and I am an 18-year-old who's passionate about being creative and
      innovative. I'm originally from the Philippines, but for the last three years, I've lived in Dubai. Motivated by a
      desire to explore deeper into the realm of web design, I enrolled in Bath Spa University's Creative Computing
      program, hoping to broaden my knowledge and talents in creating engaging web pages. I seek solace in the craft of
      photography, which captures moments that feel genuine with authenticity and emotion,
      even in the world beyond pixels and code. <br><br>

      This introduction provides an overview of my diverse journey and demonstrates my commitment to lifelong learning
      and development. Come along with me as we set off on an innovative and creative adventure where every project is a
      chance to expand the limits and have an important impact.
